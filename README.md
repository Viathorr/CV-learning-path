### ChatGPT generated 2-month Computer Vision learning plan

It is possible to gain strong insights into Computer Vision (CV) within 2-3 months, especially with consistent daily learning. However, becoming highly proficient in CV may take longer depending on the depth of knowledge and practical experience you aim to achieve. In 2-3 months, you can gain:

1. **Strong foundational knowledge of CV techniques** (CNNs, object detection, segmentation).
2. **Practical skills with key tools, libraries, and frameworks** (OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).
3. **Ability to work on real-world projects**, which is crucial for job applications.
4. **Knowledge of deployment and cloud integration**, important for production-level CV systems.

That said, mastery requires time and continuous practice. You’ll need to stay up-to-date on emerging trends, work on different projects, and refine your problem-solving skills to keep improving beyond the initial 2-3 months.
